# Notice / Credits

This repository is a fork of the OpenDeck configurator UI.

## Upstream projects

- OpenDeck firmware: https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeck
- OpenDeckUI (configurator UI): https://github.com/shanteacontrols/OpenDeckUI

## License status (important)

At the time this fork was created/updated, the upstream `shanteacontrols/OpenDeckUI` repository did not include an explicit `LICENSE` file and its `package.json` did not declare a `license` field.

That means the licensing terms for the OpenDeckUI source code are not clearly stated in the repository itself. If you intend to redistribute, ship binaries, or reuse substantial portions of this code, you should first confirm the licensing terms with the upstream author/maintainers (or ensure you have permission).

Third-party dependencies (installed via npm/yarn) are licensed separately; consult each dependency's license terms.

This notice is provided for documentation purposes and is not legal advice.
